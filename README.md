# E04a-Sprites Exercise

This is an exercise to start experimenting with sprites in Python Arcade. This repository assumes that you have Python Arcade installed.

# I have edited the readme, license, and finished the assignments asked of me. I have edited the code in main4 to display the sprites I have added into the program from an outside source.

# Enjoy!
